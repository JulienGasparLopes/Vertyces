# Vertyces

Python library to manage simple math objects.

Currently, these concepts are implemented :

- Vertex (2 and 3 dimensions, float values)
- Matrix (N, M dimensions, accepting anything)
- Rectangle (usefull to manage both position and dimensions + collisions)
- Color (some usefull colors represented as 3-dim vertices)

# Need anything ?

Feel free to create an issue !
